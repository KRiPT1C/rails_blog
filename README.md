#Learning to use Rails

I am but a lowly learner with a long way to go.

So far I have got:
..1. Ruby installed and running
..2. Rails installed and running
..3. Created a Repo and pushed my files up to github
..4. Changed this read me file

I will update this read me along the way.

For now there is not much to see...
