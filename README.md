#Learning to use Rails

I am but a lowly learner with a long way to go.

So far I have got:
- Ruby installed and running
- Rails installed and running
- Created a Repo and pushed my files up to github
- Changed this read me file
- Learned a bit of markdown so this file looks less terrible...

I will update this read me along the way.

For now there is not much to see...
